<h2 class="hidden">Description of about section</h2>
During the mid 1800's water traffic on the Great Lakes had substantially increased and the colonial government called for improved navigational tools for the mariner on Lake Huron. John Brown of Thorold was contracted to build the lighthouse on Chantry Island,  as well as 10 other lighthouses to help sailors navigate the lake. Because of the expense and difficulty of building, only six were completed. The Chantry Island lighthouse was one of these completed and it was lit on  April 1, 1859.</p>

The lighthouse stands 86 feet above water level and is 80 feet high from its base to the lights center. The lantern room of the lighthouse was fitted with a Fresnel lens built and transported from Paris, France. The first fuel used was Sperm Whale oil and the first light was a fixed light, not the familiar flashing one. Other fuels used have been Colza oil, coal oil, kerosene, acetylene and electricity. Its present day flashing light is solar powered.
